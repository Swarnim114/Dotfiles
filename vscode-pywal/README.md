# VS Code Pywal Integration

This package provides VS Code theming integration with pywal colors.

## What's Included

- **settings.json**: Complete VS Code configuration with pywal color overrides
- Comprehensive workbench theming that overrides any installed themes
- Editor token color customizations
- UI element theming (sidebar, tabs, panels, etc.)

## Features

- **Complete Interface Theming**: All VS Code UI elements themed with pywal colors
- **Extension Override**: Overrides any installed color themes (including Catppuccin)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Colors update automatically when wallpaper changes (via main wal package)
- **Token Customization**: Code syntax highlighting uses pywal colors

## Installation

```bash
# Navigate to dotfiles directory
cd ~/dotfiles

# Stow the VS Code pywal package
stow vscode-pywal

# Also ensure main wal package is stowed
stow wal
```

## Requirements

- Main `wal` package (contains update automation)
- VS Code installed
- Pywal (python-pywal)

## How It Works

1. The main `wal` package's `update-colors.sh` script automatically updates VS Code colors
2. Settings include comprehensive `workbench.colorCustomizations` that override any theme
3. Colors are sourced from `~/.config/wal/colors.json` generated by pywal

## Theming Coverage

### Editor
- Background, foreground, selection, cursor colors
- Line numbers, whitespace, indentation guides
- Search highlights, matching brackets

### Workbench  
- Sidebar, activity bar, status bar
- Tabs, panels, command palette
- Buttons, inputs, dropdowns
- Scrollbars, progress bars

### Syntax Highlighting
- Custom token colors for keywords, strings, comments
- Function, variable, and type highlighting
- Enhanced code readability with pywal colors

## Customization

Edit `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` to modify:
- Color assignments in `workbench.colorCustomizations`
- Token colors in `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`
- Additional VS Code settings

## Troubleshooting

### Colors Not Updating
1. Ensure main `wal` package is installed and working
2. Check if `~/.config/wal/colors.json` exists and is recent
3. Restart VS Code after wallpaper changes
4. Verify no conflicting extensions are overriding colors

### Extension Conflicts
- This configuration overrides all themes, including extensions
- To use a different theme, remove the color customizations
- Popular extensions like Catppuccin are automatically overridden

## Notes

- This is a separate package because VS Code requires extensive configuration
- Colors update automatically when using the wallpaper selector
- Works with any VS Code theme as it uses override configurations
- All settings preserve existing VS Code preferences not related to theming
